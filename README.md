# Graph Neural Network Watermarking

This project involves watermarking Graph Neural Networks using Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graphs.

## Features
- Generate ER graphs.
- Combine ER graphs with existing datasets: Cora and PubMed.
- Train a GNN model with the original and combined graph data.
- Test the model authenticity with the ER graph and original data.
